# Portfolio site created with Next.js and love ðŸ’•

## How it works

This was based on the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn), and is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The domain was purchased years ago from [Google Domains](http://domains.google.com/) (rip), and linked through [this helpful guide](https://gist.github.com/khushal87/81b7b74c4e5324b2ff29bbc51f059513) I found on Github.
