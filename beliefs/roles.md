- As a **people lead**, it's my job to advocate for my team, encourage healthy work habits by example, and ensure my direct reports feel supported in their current work and in their continued career growth.
- As a **project manager**, I keep the work organized and on track. If the timeline can't be met without overtime, the failure is likely on the ask and not the engineer.
- As a **technical lead**, I scope project requirements, make decisions on project architecture and review the code of my teammates.
- As an **independent contributor**, I write software, pair program and communicate my progress. My role changes moment to moment, but they are all important to the mission.
